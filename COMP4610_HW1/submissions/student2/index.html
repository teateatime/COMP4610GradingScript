                <h1>3 things I wish I knew before traveling to Japan</h1>
                <!-- Intro. Paragraph -->
                <p>Since the outbreak of Covid-19, countries worldwide have had lockdowns and issued stay-at-home orders to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is showing signs of easing as the number of people being vaccinated increases. With the infection number declining daily, people are gradually going back to their normal lives. I believe there are some people like me who are planning to travel abroad after a long stay-at-home experience. Among many countries, Japan is the one I want to visit the most. Here're the three things I would like to find out: </p>
            </div>

            <div class="body-box">
                <!-- list -->
                <ol> 
                    <li><div>Tax-free Shop</div>
                        <div class="text">We're not talking about the tax-free shops at the airport. There are many stores on the streets in Japan that give you tax refund. 
                            If you see this marks outside the store, then you can ask for a tax refund by showing your foreign passport:
                            <span class="img-box">
                                <img src="images/tax_free.jpg" alt="Tax Free Mark">
                            </span>
                            This mark usually appears at larger retailers' stores, such as Biccam or Don Quijote, but not the smaller stores like convenience stores. 
                            By doing this, you can avoid paying the 10% consumption tax. Big save!
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><div><a href="https://tabelog.com/en/" target="_blank">Tabelog</a>: Japanese version of Yelp!</div>
                        <div class="text">This app helps you look for nearby restaurants, as well as check reviews and ratings from other diners, 
                            making it easier for you to choose the most suitable restaurant. You can search restaurants by different 
                            types and price ranges. If you are interested in a specific cuisine, such as ramen, sushi, curry rice, etc., 
                            you can also use the app's search function to find recommended restaurants. The app also supports the online 
                            reservation function, so that you can easily reserve a restaurant seat, and you don't have to worry about waiting
                            in line after you walk to the restaurant. Also, Tabelog provides multiple language options, including English, 
                            Chinese, and Korean, so that you can read reviews and ratings more easily.
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><div>Japan Rail Pass (JR Pass)</div>
                        <div class="text">If you want to travel long distances in Japan, such as from Kyoto to Tokyo, the easiest and fastest way is to take 
                            the Shinkansen. The JR pass allows you unlimited travel by taking any JR train within a few days at a great price. 
                            Of course, you can choose to buy a one-way ticket. The table below helps us determine whether to purchase a JR Pass:
