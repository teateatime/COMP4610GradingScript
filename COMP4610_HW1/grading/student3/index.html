                Hello! My name is Max Tighe, and I am a CS Major at UMass Lowell. 
                I transfered to this college in 2021 after getting my assosiate's degree
                in Computer Science at 
                <a href="https://www.middlesex.mass.edu/">Middlesex Community College. </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                My main interests are programming, video editing, and video games. 
                I am currently very interested in the field of graphics programming, as well as game engine programming.
            </p>
